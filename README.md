# Pedagogical Activity Platform

The project aimed to create a modern e-journal system using an object-oriented approach, providing users with easy access to schedules, school information, and grades. Key features included user account management, semester menagement, grade management, and dynamic timetable creation. The application was built with React for the frontend, Java Spring Boot for the backend, and an Oracle SQL relational database for data management. The development was done using IntelliJ IDEA and Visual Studio Code, with Git for version control.

\* The project was initially created on GitLab in January 2025 and later transferred to GitHub without the commit history.
